        <p> <a href="https://www.saratogafalcon.org/">&nbsp;The Saratoga Falcon </a>&nbsp; was the first organization that got me into design.
          Starting as Reporter / Layout Artist, my three years on staff culminated in me becoming News Editor my senior year. Through this position, I managed the largest section of our paper (8 out of 28 page in a typical issue).
          I assigned and edited all the stories, requested photos and graphics (or made them myself when necessary), and created dummies for each page of layout.
          <br><br>
          By far my favorite part of being New Editor was having the responsibility of creating the front page of each issue our staff created. My layout was the first thing readers saw when they picked up our paper, and being able to create a good first impression was something that was incredibly rewarding.
          <br><br>
          Over the course of the year, I had the opportunity to cover some big stories on front page, including ASB having $276,000 for our Sept 25 issue, a big debate about changing our bell schedule as front page dominant for our Feb 12 issue, and a story about a case of human trafficking in Saratoga for the same issue.
          <br><br>
          The mast head at the top of this page is from the last issue I ever worked on while on staff. If you note the date, you'll see it was our April Fool's issue for which I was Editor-in-Chief. It ended up being both the most fun and most stressful issue I've ever done, and the best way I could have ended my newspaper experience. Having finished my last real issue the day before, I guess by technicality I ended my time on staff as EIC.
